# Figuring Out How To Use an Outside Libary

Something to get used to with outside libraries is googling the 'documentation' in order to figure out how to use it.  Google 'node express documentation' and click on the first link (Express 4.x API Reference)  Click on "Getting Started" in the top menu (may have to click the square thing on the top left to get it)

'Installation' will give you instructions for `npm install --save express` just like we just did.  Click on the `Hello Word` example.  We'll talk about how it's working later, but for now, cut and paste the entire example into our `server.js` file.  Save it and in the terminal type: `node server.js`

It should print 'Example app listening on port 3000!' and then (behind the scenes) start it's infinite event loop.  Now we can check to see if it's working.

Open your chrome browser and point it to `localhost:3000`  You should get the message 'Hello World!'
